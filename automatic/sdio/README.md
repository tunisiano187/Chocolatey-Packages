## Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO)
Snappy Driver Installer Origin is a fork of Snappy Driver Installer starting at version `r541`. The old project is no longer in the hands of the original developers, is no longer open source and is not safe to use.

Snappy Driver Installer Origin remains a free, open source project. Free means it costs you nothing to download and use. Free means it is free of adware, malware, backdoors, unwanted third party software or other dodgy stuff.

### Usage

Launch the SDIO_auto.bat file and it will start the software depending on your system
